Acknowledging fcmaker
=====================

1) Only use lower case letters when mentioning fcmaker, and always include the version number.
   Ideally, you should also include the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) associated with any 
   of the Github releases, e.g.:
   
   fcmaker |version|: |DOI_latest|
   
-----
   
2) If you use fcmaker for your observations (and remember that you did so by the time you
   reach the publication stage!), I would very much welcome a friendly nudge along the 
   following blurb::
   
    This research has made use of \textsc{fcmaker}, a Python module to create 
    ESO-compliant finding charts automatically. \textsc{fcmaker} relies on 
    \textsc{matplotlib} (Hunter 2007), \textsc{aplpy}, an open-source plotting package for 
    Python (Robitaille 2012), \textsc{astropy}, a community-developed core Python package 
    for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2013), and \textsc{montage}, funded by 
    the National Science Foundation under Grant Number ACI-1440620 and previously funded 
    by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s Earth Science Technology Office,
    Computation Technologies Project, under Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626 between
    NASA and the California Institute of Technology. \textsc{fcmaker} uses the VizieR 
    catalogue access tool, CDS, Strasbourg, France. The original description of the VizieR 
    service was published in Ochsenbein (2000).
