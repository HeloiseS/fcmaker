To build the site:

sphinx-build -a -b html source build

To include the docs in the pypi distribution, create the final docs inside the package

sphinx-build -a -b html source ../fcmaker/docs/

To generate all the function docs automatically, use

sphinx-apidoc —f -o source/modules/ ../fcmaker/

and change the title in modules.rst to “The functions of fcmaker”

Ipython Notebook are now formatted well without further manual tweak thanks to the nbsphinx package. References and the like may need to be included in them in a NBconvert cell with reST format. 

Any example file (like the csv input files) have been included in the test_arena, so they are shipped with the package.
