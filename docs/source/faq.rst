**Q: If fcmaker is not an official ESO tool, will the fcmaker charts still be accepted in Phase 2?**

   **A**: fcmaker is developed by an ESO Fellow with duties on UT4 at the VLT, but it is *not* an official ESO tool. Still, the fcmaker charts match all the official ESO requirements for finding charts, and were fine-tuned to meet the specific needs of the telescope operators and night astronomers during operations. The hope is that the inclusion of fcmaker finding charts in OBs will thus remain tolerated.
