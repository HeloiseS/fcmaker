Troubleshooting 
---------------

1. 
If you encounter errors when running fcmaker, first ensure that your numpy, scipy, 
matplotlib, aplpy, and astropy packages are up-to-date, then try again. 
  
2. 
If you still encounter errors after doing that, check the :ref:`faq`.
  
3. 
Check if this is one of the known |issues|
  
4. 
If you still can't figure out what's wrong, please `submit a new issue on the Github 
repository of the project <https://github.com/fpavogt/fcmaker/issues>`_. Provide as much 
detail as possible (error message, minimal example able to reproduce the error, 
operating system, Python version, etc ...).

.. note::
   Submitting a Github issue is the best way for you to get help rapidly, for us to keep 
   track of the problems that need solving, and for future users to see what changes have 
   been made over time (and look for existing solutions to their problem which may be the 
   same as yours). Submitting a new issue on Github is rapid and easy, but if you are 
   really against doing it (why would you ?), you can always email 
   frederic.vogt@alumni.anu.edu.au for help.
